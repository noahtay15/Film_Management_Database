# Film_Management_Database
Another course assignment from my File and Database Processing Class. Used HTML, PHP, and MySQL queries to add new films to the database and pull up a table with all the customers, with a list of things like their addresses and films they have rented in the past. Once again, this is locally hosted with XAMPP. Additionally, no CSS or javascript was used, as I didn't know either at the time. 

SakilaDatabase.PNG is a picture of the ER diagram of the database we used throughout the class, so in this specific assignment, I don't think I used all of the database. There are also pictures of most of the screens that that the user would be able to see.
